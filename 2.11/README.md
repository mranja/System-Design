# Incident Retrieval Schema Repair — LU 2.11 Assignment

## What This Is

The platform is shipping its first AI feature: surface the **three most similar past incidents** when a responder opens a new one. A colleague drafted the **retrieval schema** — the `incident_chunks` table that holds embedded incident text for vector similarity search — in `migrations/001_retrieval_schema.sql`. It has **intentional errors**: the embedding is stored as plain `TEXT` instead of a `vector`, the foreign key is the wrong type with no `ON DELETE`, the filter-metadata columns are missing, there are no indexes, and a rejected shape (a single embedding column on `incidents`) made it in.

Your job: **fix the retrieval schema so it correctly implements the retrieval spec** in the assignment question. The spec is the source of truth.

When you're done, all **20 pgTAP tests** must pass.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Why | Check |
|------|-----|-------|
| PostgreSQL (v14+) | Runs the test database | `psql --version` |
| **pgvector** | Provides the `vector` type and HNSW index | `SELECT '[1,2,3]'::vector;` |
| pgTAP | Test framework for schema validation | `pg_prove --version` |
| pg_prove | pgTAP test runner | comes with pgTAP |
| Node.js + npm | Runs the helper scripts | `node --version` |

### Easiest setup — Docker (Postgres + pgvector preinstalled)

```bash
docker run --name incident-pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d pgvector/pgvector:pg16
```

### Installing pgvector manually

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install pgvector
```

**Ubuntu / Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql-16-pgvector   # match your postgres version
```

### Installing pgTAP

**macOS:** `brew install pgtap` · **Ubuntu:** `sudo apt-get install postgresql-16-pgtap`

Both extensions are enabled automatically by `npm run db:reset` (it runs `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;` and `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgtap;`).

---

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or fork the repo

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd incident-retrieval-repair
```

### Step 2: Make sure PostgreSQL (with pgvector) is running

```bash
# Docker
docker start incident-pg
# or local service: brew services start postgresql / sudo service postgresql start
```

### Step 3: Create the test database and apply the schema

```bash
npm run db:reset
```

This drops `incident_retrieval_test`, recreates it, enables the `vector` and `pgtap` extensions, and applies `migrations/001_retrieval_schema.sql`.

> ⚠️ "role does not exist" → add `-U postgres` to each `psql` command in the `db:reset` script in `package.json`.

### Step 4: Run the tests

```bash
npm test
```

The first run **fails most tests** — the schema is broken. Fix it until all 20 pass.

## What the Tests Check

| Category | Tests | What they check |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Table existence | 2 | `incidents` and `incident_chunks` exist |
| Column types | 7 | `id`/`incident_id`/`team_id` are BIGINT, `embedding` is `vector(1536)` (not TEXT), `created_at` is TIMESTAMPTZ |
| NOT NULL | 6 | `incident_id`, `chunk_text`, `embedding`, `team_id`, `severity`, `created_at` are required |
| Foreign key | 1 | `incident_chunks.incident_id` references `incidents.id` |
| Indexes | 2 | HNSW ANN index on `embedding`; B-tree index on `incident_id` |
| Rejected shape | 1 | `incidents.embedding` column is gone |
| ON DELETE CASCADE | 1 | deleting an incident removes its chunks |

## The File to Fix

**Only edit this file:**

```
migrations/001_retrieval_schema.sql
```

Every broken line has a `-- wrong:` or `-- MISSING:` comment. Read each one.

## Hints

Work top to bottom.

**Hint 1 — Enable pgvector first.**
Add `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;` at the very top. Without it, `vector(1536)` will error with `type "vector" does not exist`.

**Hint 2 — The embedding is a vector, not text.**
`embedding TEXT` → `embedding vector(1536) NOT NULL`. A stringified vector cannot be indexed or compared with the `<=>` cosine-distance operator. The whole point of retrieval storage is the native vector type.

**Hint 3 — The FK type and ON DELETE.**
`incidents.id` is `BIGSERIAL` (a `bigint`), so the FK must be `BIGINT`, not `INTEGER`. A chunk has no meaning without its incident, so the behaviour is `ON DELETE CASCADE`:
`incident_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES incidents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`.

**Hint 4 — Add the filter metadata.**
Hybrid retrieval filters by team and severity alongside the similarity ranking. Add `team_id BIGINT NOT NULL` and `severity TEXT NOT NULL` to `incident_chunks`. These are denormalised copies — a deliberate, access-pattern-driven choice (LU16).

**Hint 5 — Timestamps.**
`created_at` should be `TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()`.

**Hint 6 — Remove the rejected shape.**
Delete the `ALTER TABLE incidents ADD COLUMN embedding TEXT;` line. One embedding per incident cannot represent a long, multi-paragraph description — you need multiple chunks per incident, each its own vector. That is exactly why `incident_chunks` exists (one-to-many from `incidents`).

**Hint 7 — Add both indexes.**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_incident_chunks_embedding
  ON incident_chunks USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
CREATE INDEX idx_incident_chunks_incident_id
  ON incident_chunks (incident_id);
```

---

## Workflow

```bash
# 1. Edit the schema
nano migrations/001_retrieval_schema.sql

# 2. Re-apply from scratch
npm run db:reset

# 3. Run the tests
npm test

# 4. Repeat until all 20 pass
```

## Common Errors

**`ERROR: type "vector" does not exist`**
→ Add `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;` at the top of the SQL file (and make sure pgvector is installed — use the Docker image if unsure).

**`ERROR: access method "hnsw" does not exist`**
→ Your pgvector version is too old (HNSW needs pgvector ≥ 0.5.0). Update pgvector, or use `ivfflat` only if your environment requires it — but the tests expect the index named `idx_incident_chunks_embedding` to exist.

**`ERROR: foreign key constraint ... cannot be implemented` / type mismatch**
→ The FK column type must match the referenced PK type. `incidents.id` is `bigint`, so `incident_id` must be `BIGINT`, not `INTEGER`.

**`ERROR: column "embedding" of relation "incidents" does not exist`** (in tests)
→ Good — that means you removed the rejected shape. The `hasnt_column` test wants it gone.

**`pg_prove: command not found`** → pgTAP isn't installed or on PATH. See prerequisites.

**`psql: error: connection to server failed`** → PostgreSQL isn't running.

## Submission

Once all 20 tests pass:

1. Commit to a branch called `retrieval-schema-repair`:
```bash
git checkout -b retrieval-schema-repair
git add migrations/001_retrieval_schema.sql README.md
git commit -m "fix: repair the incident retrieval schema to match the spec"
```

2. Update this `README.md` with exactly **3 retrieval-model decisions** and **1 rejected shape**:

```markdown
## Retrieval-Model Decisions

### Decision 1: [Embedding storage decision]

## Rejected Shape

### Shape: [name what you removed or rejected]

```


3. Push and open a PR:
```bash
git push origin retrieval-schema-repair
```

4. Paste your `npm test` output (all 20 passing) into the PR description.

## What You May Not Do

- Change the retrieval spec (it is the source of truth)
- Add columns not in the spec
- Store the embedding as `TEXT`, `JSON`, or `float8[]` — it must be `vector(1536)`
- Skip `ON DELETE` on the FK — it must be explicit `ON DELETE CASCADE`
- Use `SERIAL`/`INTEGER` for the PK or FK
- Leave the `incidents.embedding` rejected column in place
- Skip either required index
